Attach a sign to a block and write your configuration 
In the first line you type: [ps]
In the second line you type the mobname, like: bluesheep
(Optional) In the third line you write the amount, like: 3
Finish editing the sign
Place 2 redstone wires heading to the sign
Power the redstone wire and a mob will spawn 2 blocks above the sign!
